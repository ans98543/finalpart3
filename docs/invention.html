    The creation of the Internet is the most defining technology of the era.
    Many historic accolades are accredited to this invention.
    The evolution of the Internet has enhanced communication for humans.
    People who own computers are able to communicate and make new relationships through the web.
    In the beginning, people socialized through email, newsgroups, and even chat rooms.
    Millions can access old or new information in a matter of seconds. <br>
    The internet has been helpful by bringing awareness to many inhumane tragedies which led to these crises being stopped.
    More importantly, the origin of the Internet goes all the way back to the 1950s.
    In 1998 the Internet generated 300 billion for businesses and became 1/3 of the economic growth in the United States.
    More importantly, the doctor behind the psychological concept of the Internet was created by JCR Licklider.
    He was a professor at Massachusetts Institute of technology dating back to the 1950s.
    He believed computers would allow people to communicate more efficiently which would enhance the ability to create a web of shared info for people.
    The first generation of computers were big machines.<br>
    Interestingly a team named ARPA was a space program that focused on computer science projects. They were able to obtain NASA computers.
    This began a competition for successful space projects against the Russians.
    This also led to the mission of the US sending a man to the moon and having him come back safely.
    Furthermore, a student Leonard Kleinrock started the theory of data transmission. He was able to speed up the network analyzing with demand access and distributed control.<br>
    This was a key thing for consistent info sharing over data networks. His work initiated the spark of new communication.
    This began the circuit switching between telephones. However the fear of nuclear destruction could destroy this technique.
    Notably, Paul Buran and his team developed the hot potato routing method. The network data was placed in postal card-sized packets.
    <br>This worked better than the telephone system but still had flaws. By 1962 enough research was done to create a reliable network.
    People used terminals to send messages. Scientists had to use more than one terminal to send multiple messages and this was frustrating.
    Bob Taylor was a part of ARPA and he wanted to build a network for all computers to share.
    He urged his boss to provide money for this because it will save time and extra resources in the future.
    He was giving one million dollars and his idea changed the world. Taylor hires Job Roberts because he was the first to link two computers in Lexington Massachusetts.
    He was also one of the first to build the first network. Then Roberts got the idea to attach small computers to main terminals to structure a network.
